Yonde is a sports themed anime forum wherin sports anime enthusiasts can interact with each other within a community of like-minded people.
Translated from the Japanese word "read", our website draws inspiration from Reddit, Facebook, and other community forums on the internet.

CRUZ, Mia Bernice A.
DE CASTRO, Pheonix Claire V.
EXCONDE, Isiah Reuben C.
MARTIN, Gian Andrei M.
